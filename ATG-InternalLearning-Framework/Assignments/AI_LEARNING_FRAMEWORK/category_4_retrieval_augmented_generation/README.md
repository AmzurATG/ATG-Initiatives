## Notes

- RAG is one of the most practical and widely-used AI application patterns
- Recommended order: 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4 (fundamentals to production)
- These topics build on each other - each assumes knowledge from previous ones
- RAG vs fine-tuning decision is critical (compare with 3.3)
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- 4.1 compares with Category 3.3 (Fine-tuning) for decision-making
- 4.2 is foundational - embeddings are used throughout AI applications
- 4.3 and 4.4 build towards production systems (connects to Category 7 - MLOps)
- RAG is commonly used with frameworks in Category 5 (LangChain, etc.)

---

## Practical Importance

RAG is currently the most common approach for:
- Enterprise knowledge bases
- Document Q&A systems
- Customer support automation
- Research and analysis tools

Understanding RAG deeply is essential for most ATG projects.
