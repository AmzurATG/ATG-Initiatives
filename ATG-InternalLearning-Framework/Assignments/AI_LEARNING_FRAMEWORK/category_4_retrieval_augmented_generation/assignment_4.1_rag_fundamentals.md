# Lesson Plan Assignment: RAG Fundamentals

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
**Subcategory:** 4.1 RAG Fundamentals  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Explain what RAG is and how it differs from standalone LLM usage
2. Understand when to use RAG vs fine-tuning vs prompt engineering
3. Implement a basic RAG pipeline with code examples

---

## Topics to Cover

- **RAG Architecture:** Retrieval + augmentation + generation workflow and components
- **Why RAG:** Benefits over fine-tuning, knowledge freshness, source attribution
- **Use Cases:** Document Q&A, knowledge bases, customer support, research assistants
- **RAG vs Alternatives:** Comparison with fine-tuning, prompt engineering, hybrid approaches

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides with RAG architecture diagrams showing data flow
- Include decision matrix: when to use RAG vs fine-tuning vs prompting
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a simple RAG application (e.g., document Q&A system)
- Demonstrate retrieval → augmentation → generation pipeline
- Show comparison: LLM alone vs LLM with RAG

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (LangChain docs, RAG papers, tutorials)
- Create decision tree for choosing RAG vs other approaches
- Share starter code template for basic RAG implementation

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "For our current project X, would RAG be appropriate? Why?"
  - "What are the main challenges in implementing RAG?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Explore LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar RAG frameworks
- **Practice:** Build and test demo with sample documents (PDFs, markdown files)
- **Collaborate:** One focuses on concepts/architecture, other on implementation
- **Engage:** Show before/after comparison (LLM alone vs RAG)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands the RAG architecture and workflow
- [ ] Clear explanation of when and why to use RAG
- [ ] Working code demo retrieves and generates accurate answers
- [ ] Team can identify RAG opportunities in their projects
- [ ] Comparison with alternatives (fine-tuning, prompting) is clear

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 4.1
- LangChain/LlamaIndex documentation
- "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks" paper
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Keep code example simple but functional
- Focus on the retrieval → augmentation → generation flow
- Discuss real ATG project applications
- This is foundational for all subsequent RAG topics
