# Lesson Plan Assignment: Advanced RAG Techniques

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
**Subcategory:** 4.3 Advanced RAG Techniques  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Implement effective document chunking strategies for better retrieval
2. Apply hybrid search combining vector and keyword approaches
3. Use re-ranking and filtering to improve retrieval quality

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Chunking Strategies:** Fixed-size, semantic, recursive, overlap techniques
- **Hybrid Search:** Combining vector similarity with keyword search (BM25)
- **Re-ranking:** Cross-encoder models, relevance scoring, LLM-based re-ranking
- **Context Optimization:** Maximizing context window usage, compression techniques

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides comparing different chunking and retrieval strategies
- Include performance comparisons with metrics
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Demonstrate different chunking approaches and their impact
- Build hybrid search combining vector + keyword methods
- Show re-ranking improving retrieval quality

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on advanced RAG techniques
- Create best practices guide for chunking and retrieval
- Share code implementing various advanced techniques

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What chunking strategy works best for our document types?"
  - "When is the complexity of re-ranking worth it?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study LangChain, LlamaIndex advanced RAG patterns
- **Practice:** Test different chunking sizes and overlap settings
- **Collaborate:** One covers chunking/search, other demonstrates re-ranking
- **Engage:** Show side-by-side quality comparison of techniques

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands impact of chunking on retrieval quality
- [ ] Hybrid search benefits clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Working examples show measurable quality improvements
- [ ] Best practices guide created for implementation
- [ ] Team can optimize RAG systems for better performance

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 4.3
- LangChain/LlamaIndex advanced retrieval docs
- Research papers on RAG improvements
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on practical improvements with measurable impact
- Show metrics: accuracy, relevance scores before/after
- Discuss trade-offs: quality vs latency vs cost
- Build on fundamentals from 4.1 and 4.2
