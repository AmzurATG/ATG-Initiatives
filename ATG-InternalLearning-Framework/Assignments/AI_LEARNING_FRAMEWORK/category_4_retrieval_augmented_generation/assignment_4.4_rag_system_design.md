# Lesson Plan Assignment: RAG System Design

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
**Subcategory:** 4.4 RAG System Design  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Design end-to-end RAG systems with proper document processing pipelines
2. Implement metadata filtering and query optimization strategies
3. Monitor and evaluate RAG system performance in production

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Document Preprocessing:** Parsing PDFs, extracting tables, handling various formats, cleaning
- **Metadata & Filtering:** Document metadata for filtering, access control, temporal filtering
- **Query Optimization:** Query expansion, hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE), query routing
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracking retrieval quality, latency, costs, user feedback loops

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides showing complete RAG system architecture
- Include best practices for production RAG systems
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build end-to-end document processing pipeline
- Demonstrate metadata filtering and query optimization
- Show monitoring dashboard or logging for RAG metrics

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on production RAG systems
- Create architecture template for RAG applications
- Share monitoring and evaluation frameworks

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we evaluate if our RAG system is performing well?"
  - "What's the maintenance overhead of a production RAG system?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study production RAG implementations and case studies
- **Practice:** Build complete pipeline from document ingestion to monitoring
- **Collaborate:** One covers preprocessing/metadata, other handles optimization/monitoring
- **Engage:** Walk through real system architecture decisions

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team can design complete RAG system architecture
- [ ] Document processing pipeline demonstrated with real files
- [ ] Metadata filtering and query optimization working
- [ ] Monitoring strategy defined with relevant metrics
- [ ] Production readiness checklist created

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 4.4
- Production RAG system case studies
- LangSmith, LangFuse for monitoring
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on production readiness, not just prototypes
- Discuss scalability, reliability, and maintenance
- Include cost optimization strategies
- This brings together all RAG concepts from 4.1-4.3
