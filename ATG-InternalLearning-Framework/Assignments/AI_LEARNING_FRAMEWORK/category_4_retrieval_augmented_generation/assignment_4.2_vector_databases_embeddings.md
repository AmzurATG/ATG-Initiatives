# Lesson Plan Assignment: Vector Databases & Embeddings

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
**Subcategory:** 4.2 Vector Databases & Embeddings  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand what embeddings are and how they capture semantic meaning
2. Perform vector similarity search for document retrieval
3. Evaluate and choose appropriate vector databases for projects

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Embeddings Basics:** What are embeddings, semantic similarity, embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere, open-source)
- **Vector Similarity:** Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product
- **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, pgvector - comparison and selection
- **Indexing Strategies:** HNSW, IVF, product quantization for performance

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining embeddings with visualizations
- Include comparison matrix of vector database options
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build embedding generation and similarity search example
- Demonstrate vector database setup and querying (use Chroma or similar)
- Show how similar documents are retrieved based on semantic meaning

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on embeddings and vector databases
- Create selection guide for choosing vector database
- Share code templates for common vector DB operations

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which vector database should we use for our scale?"
  - "How do we choose the right embedding model?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Test multiple embedding models and vector databases
- **Practice:** Index documents and experiment with similarity searches
- **Collaborate:** One covers embeddings theory, other demonstrates vector DB usage
- **Engage:** Interactive demo: team provides queries, see what gets retrieved

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands how embeddings represent semantic meaning
- [ ] Clear explanation of vector similarity metrics
- [ ] Working demo shows embedding generation and search
- [ ] Vector database comparison helps with selection decisions
- [ ] Team can implement vector search for projects

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 4.2
- LangChain vector store documentation
- Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Use visualization tools to show embeddings in 2D/3D space
- Demonstrate with real text examples to show semantic understanding
- Discuss cost and performance trade-offs for different databases
- This enables the retrieval step in RAG systems
