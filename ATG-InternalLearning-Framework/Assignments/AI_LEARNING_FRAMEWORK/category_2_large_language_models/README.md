## Notes

- These topics are crucial for anyone working with LLMs
- Recommended order: 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 (architecture first, then practical usage)
- Prompt Engineering (2.3) is immediately applicable and highly practical
- Model Landscape (2.4) helps with project planning and vendor selection
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- 2.1 builds on Category 1.2 (Deep Learning Foundations - Transformers)
- 2.3 (Prompt Engineering) is foundational for Categories 3-6
- 2.4 connects to Category 12 (Business & Strategy)
