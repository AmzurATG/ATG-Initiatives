# Lesson Plan Assignment: LLM Architecture & Theory

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 2: Large Language Models (LLMs)  
**Subcategory:** 2.1 LLM Architecture & Theory  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Explain the Transformer architecture and its key components
2. Understand attention mechanisms and why they're crucial for LLMs
3. Differentiate between pre-training and fine-tuning approaches

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Transformer Architecture:** Encoder-decoder structure, self-attention, positional encoding
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Self-attention, multi-head attention, how attention works
- **Model Parameters & Context:** Model size implications, context window limitations, memory requirements
- **Pre-training vs Fine-tuning:** Training approaches, when to use each, computational costs

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides with visual diagrams of Transformer architecture
- Include attention mechanism visualization with examples
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Demonstrate how attention works with a simple code example
- Show loading and using a pre-trained model (e.g., from Hugging Face)
- Visualize attention weights on sample text

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (Illustrated Transformer, Attention Is All You Need paper, videos)
- Create a comparison chart: GPT vs BERT vs T5 architectures
- Share links to interactive attention visualizations

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Why did Transformers replace RNNs for NLP tasks?"
  - "What determines the context window size we can use?"

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Read "Attention Is All You Need" paper and Jay Alammar's blog posts
- **Practice:** Load models from Hugging Face and experiment with them
- **Collaborate:** One covers architecture theory, other demonstrates practical usage
- **Engage:** Use animations or interactive tools to show attention in action

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands Transformer architecture fundamentals
- [ ] Attention mechanism is clearly explained with examples
- [ ] Working code demonstrates using pre-trained models
- [ ] Team understands trade-offs between model sizes
- [ ] Difference between pre-training and fine-tuning is clear

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 2.1
- "The Illustrated Transformer" by Jay Alammar
- Hugging Face Transformers documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on intuition - avoid heavy mathematical details
- Use visual aids extensively for architecture explanation
- Connect to practical model selection decisions
- This sets foundation for all subsequent LLM topics
