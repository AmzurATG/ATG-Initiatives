# Lesson Plan Assignment: LLM Model Landscape

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 2: Large Language Models (LLMs)  
**Subcategory:** 2.4 LLM Model Landscape  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Compare major LLM providers and their offerings (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
2. Make informed decisions between open-source and proprietary models
3. Evaluate models based on cost, performance, and project requirements

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Major Providers:** OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Meta (Llama)
- **Open-source Models:** Llama, Mistral, Falcon - pros/cons vs proprietary
- **Model Selection Criteria:** Task requirements, cost, latency, privacy, customization needs
- **Cost & Performance Trade-offs:** Pricing models, throughput, quality comparison, ROI analysis

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create comparison matrix of major LLM providers and models
- Include pricing comparison with real-world cost examples
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a simple abstraction layer to switch between different LLM providers
- Demonstrate same task with multiple models showing quality/cost differences
- Create a cost calculator tool for estimating project expenses

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (model cards, benchmarks, pricing pages)
- Create decision tree for model selection based on use case
- Share comparison spreadsheet with current pricing and capabilities

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which model should we use for our current projects?"
  - "When does it make sense to host our own open-source model?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Review official documentation and pricing for all major providers
- **Practice:** Test same prompts across different models to compare outputs
- **Collaborate:** One covers proprietary models, other covers open-source options
- **Engage:** Live comparison demo showing quality and response differences

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands landscape of available LLM options
- [ ] Clear comparison of major providers and their strengths
- [ ] Working code demonstrates multi-provider abstraction
- [ ] Cost estimation tool created for project planning
- [ ] Decision framework established for model selection

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 2.4
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI documentation
- Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Keep pricing information current (it changes frequently)
- Include real project cost scenarios
- Discuss vendor lock-in considerations
- This directly impacts project planning and budgeting
