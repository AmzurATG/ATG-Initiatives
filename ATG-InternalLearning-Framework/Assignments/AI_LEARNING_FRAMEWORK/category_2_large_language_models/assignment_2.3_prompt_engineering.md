# Lesson Plan Assignment: Prompt Engineering

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 2: Large Language Models (LLMs)  
**Subcategory:** 2.3 Prompt Engineering  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Write effective prompts using established design principles
2. Apply few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques appropriately
3. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to improve LLM outputs

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Prompt Design Principles:** Clarity, specificity, context, role assignment, output formatting
- **Few-shot vs Zero-shot:** When to use examples, how many examples, example selection
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Step-by-step reasoning, "Let's think step by step", CoT benefits
- **Optimization Techniques:** Iterative refinement, A/B testing prompts, prompt templates

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides with before/after prompt examples showing improvements
- Include prompt engineering patterns and anti-patterns
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a prompt testing framework to compare different approaches
- Demonstrate few-shot learning with varied example counts
- Show chain-of-thought reasoning impact on complex tasks

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (OpenAI prompt engineering guide, research papers)
- Create a prompt template library for common tasks
- Share a prompt optimization checklist

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we systematically improve prompts for our use cases?"
  - "What's the ROI of spending time on prompt optimization?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study OpenAI/Anthropic prompt engineering guides
- **Practice:** Test various prompting techniques with real tasks
- **Collaborate:** One covers theory/patterns, other shows optimization process
- **Engage:** Live prompt improvement session with team participation
