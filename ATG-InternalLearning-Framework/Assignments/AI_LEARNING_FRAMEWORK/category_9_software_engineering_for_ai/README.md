## Notes

- Software engineering fundamentals apply to AI development
- Recommended order: 9.3 → 9.1 → 9.2 → 9.4 (quality → patterns → testing → architecture)
- These practices ensure maintainable AI systems
- Strong connection to Software Engineering Excellence Framework
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- Category 9 bridges AI and Software Engineering frameworks
- 9.1 and 9.4 connect to SE Framework Category 1 and 6
- 9.2 connects to SE Framework Category 7
- 9.3 connects to SE Framework Category 5
- Essential for professional AI development

---

## Practical Importance

Good software engineering practices:
- Make AI systems maintainable
- Enable team collaboration
- Reduce technical debt
- Improve system reliability

AI without SE fundamentals = unmaintainable code.
