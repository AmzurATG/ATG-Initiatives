# Lesson Plan Assignment: Architecture Patterns

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 9: Software Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 9.4 Architecture Patterns  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Apply microservices architecture to AI systems
2. Understand event-driven architecture for AI
3. Use domain-driven design principles for AI applications

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Microservices Architecture:** Service boundaries for AI, service communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Events, event sourcing, CQRS for AI systems
- **CQRS & Event Sourcing:** Command-query separation, audit trails
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Bounded contexts, ubiquitous language for AI domains

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides on architecture patterns with AI examples
- Include architecture diagrams for each pattern
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Implement microservices for AI application
- Demonstrate event-driven pattern
- Show domain-driven design in AI context

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on architecture patterns
- Create architecture decision framework
- Share reference architectures and templates

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which architecture pattern fits our system?"
  - "How do we migrate to better architecture?"
