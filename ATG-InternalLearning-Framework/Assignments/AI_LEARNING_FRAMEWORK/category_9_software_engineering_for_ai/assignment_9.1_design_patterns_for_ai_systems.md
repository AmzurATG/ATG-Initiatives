# Lesson Plan Assignment: Design Patterns for AI Systems

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 9: Software Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 9.1 Design Patterns for AI Systems  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Apply classic design patterns to AI system development
2. Implement adapter pattern for model switching
3. Use strategy and factory patterns for AI components

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Adapter Pattern:** Switching between different LLM providers seamlessly
- **Strategy Pattern:** Managing different prompt strategies and model selection
- **Observer Pattern:** Monitoring and logging AI system behavior
- **Factory Pattern:** Creating appropriate models/agents based on context

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining patterns with AI-specific examples
- Include UML diagrams and code structure
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Implement adapter pattern for multi-provider LLM support
- Demonstrate strategy pattern for prompt management
- Show factory pattern for model selection

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on design patterns for AI
- Create pattern catalog for AI systems
- Share code templates for each pattern

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which patterns solve our current architectural challenges?"
  - "How do patterns improve maintainability?"
