2. Establish and follow documentation standards
3. Conduct effective code reviews for AI systems

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Clean Code for AI:** Naming, organization, readability for AI components
- **Documentation Standards:** Docstrings, API docs, architecture docs for AI
- **Code Review Practices:** Reviewing prompts, chains, agents - what to look for
- **Technical Debt:** Managing debt in AI systems, refactoring strategies

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides on code quality standards for AI
- Include before/after examples of clean code
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Refactor messy AI code to clean code
- Demonstrate proper documentation
- Show code review process for AI components

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on clean code and documentation
- Create team coding standards document
- Share linting configs and pre-commit hooks

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What coding standards should we enforce?"
  - "How do we review prompts and AI logic?"
