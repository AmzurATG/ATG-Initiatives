# Lesson Plan Assignment: Testing AI Applications

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 9: Software Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 9.2 Testing AI Applications  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Write effective unit tests for AI components
2. Implement integration testing strategies for AI systems
3. Use evaluation frameworks for testing AI quality

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Unit Testing AI:** Testing prompts, parsers, chains, deterministic components
- **Integration Testing:** Testing AI workflows end-to-end, mocking LLM calls
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** LLM-as-judge, human evaluation, metrics
- **Test Data Management:** Fixtures, golden datasets, versioning test data

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides on testing strategies for AI systems
- Include testing pyramid adapted for AI
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Write unit tests for AI components
- Demonstrate integration tests with mocked LLM calls
- Show evaluation framework for AI quality

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on testing AI applications
- Create testing checklist and best practices guide
- Share test templates and fixtures

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we test non-deterministic AI outputs?"
  - "What's our testing strategy for AI features?"
