# Lesson Plan Assignment: Integration Patterns

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 6: AI Application Development  
**Subcategory:** 6.4 Integration Patterns  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Implement robust API integration strategies for AI services
2. Handle streaming vs batch responses appropriately
3. Design effective error handling and retry logic

---

## Topics to Cover

- **API Integration Strategies:** REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, SDKs vs direct API calls
- **Streaming vs Batch:** Server-sent events, streaming APIs, batch processing
- **Error Handling & Retries:** Exponential backoff, circuit breakers, fallback strategies
- **Rate Limiting & Quotas:** Managing API limits, request throttling, quota monitoring

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides showing integration patterns with sequence diagrams
- Include error handling decision trees
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build robust API integration with error handling and retries
- Demonstrate streaming response handling
- Show rate limit management and monitoring

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on API integration best practices
- Create integration patterns library
- Share code templates for common scenarios

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we handle API failures gracefully in production?"
  - "What retry strategy should we use for different scenarios?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, timeout)
- **Practice:** Implement integrations with error simulation
- **Collaborate:** One covers patterns, other demonstrates implementation
- **Engage:** Live demo of failure scenarios and recovery

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands robust integration patterns
- [ ] Clear strategies for error handling and retries
- [ ] Working examples handle failures gracefully
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management demonstrated
- [ ] Integration patterns library created

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 6.4
- OpenAI, Anthropic API documentation
- Resilience patterns documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on production reliability
- Show what happens when APIs fail
- Discuss cost implications of retries
- This is critical for production AI applications
