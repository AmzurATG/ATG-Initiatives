---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 6: AI Application Development  
**Subcategory:** 6.3 Tech Stack for AI Applications  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Select appropriate backend and frontend frameworks for AI applications
2. Understand real-time vs batch processing trade-offs
3. Implement effective state management in AI applications

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Backend Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask, Express.js - choosing for AI workloads
- **Frontend Integration:** React, Vue, Svelte - patterns for AI features
- **Real-time vs Batch:** Streaming responses, websockets, async processing, queues
- **State Management:** Session management, conversation history, user context

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides comparing tech stack options for AI apps
- Include decision matrix for framework selection
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a full-stack AI application with chosen tech stack
- Demonstrate streaming responses in UI
- Show state management for conversational AI

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on AI application tech stacks
- Create starter templates for common stack combinations
- Share performance benchmarks and comparisons

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What tech stack should we standardize on for AI projects?"
  - "How do we handle long-running AI operations in the UI?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Explore popular AI application stacks
- **Practice:** Build sample apps with different combinations
- **Collaborate:** One covers backend, other demonstrates frontend
- **Engage:** Live coding of full-stack AI feature
