---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 6: AI Application Development  
**Subcategory:** 6.2 GitHub Copilot & AI-Assisted Coding  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Use GitHub Copilot and AI coding assistants effectively
2. Identify best practices and anti-patterns for AI-assisted coding
3. Conduct proper code review of AI-generated code

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Effective Usage:** Writing good prompts for code generation, context provision, iterative refinement
- **Best Practices:** When to accept suggestions, when to write manually, documentation generation
- **Anti-Patterns:** Over-reliance, accepting without understanding, security concerns
- **Code Review:** Reviewing AI-generated code for quality, security, and correctness

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides with do's and don'ts for AI coding assistants
- Include real examples of good and bad AI-generated code
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Live demonstration of effective Copilot usage
- Show code review process for AI-generated code
- Demonstrate debugging and fixing AI suggestions

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on AI-assisted coding best practices
- Create team guidelines for AI coding tool usage
- Share prompt patterns for common coding tasks

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What code review standards apply to AI-generated code?"
  - "How do we ensure code quality with AI assistance?"
