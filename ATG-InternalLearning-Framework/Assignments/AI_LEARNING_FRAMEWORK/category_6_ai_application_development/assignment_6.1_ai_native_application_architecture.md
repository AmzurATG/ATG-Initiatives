# Lesson Plan Assignment: AI-Native Application Architecture

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 6: AI Application Development  
**Subcategory:** 6.1 AI-Native Application Architecture  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Design application architectures optimized for AI/LLM integration
2. Understand microservices patterns for AI systems
3. Apply scalability considerations for AI applications

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Application Design Patterns:** API-first design, event-driven architecture, stateless services
- **Microservices for AI:** Service boundaries, AI service isolation, communication patterns
- **API Design for LLMs:** Async processing, streaming responses, timeout handling
- **Scalability Considerations:** Load balancing, caching strategies, rate limiting

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides showing AI-native architecture patterns with diagrams
- Include comparison: traditional vs AI-native architecture
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a sample AI application with proper architecture
- Demonstrate async processing and streaming responses
- Show API design with error handling and retries

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on AI application architecture
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs) template
- Share reference architectures for common AI patterns

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we architect for reliability with external AI APIs?"
  - "What are the key differences from traditional app architecture?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study production AI application architectures
- **Practice:** Design and implement sample architecture
- **Collaborate:** One covers patterns, other demonstrates implementation
- **Engage:** Diagram review session with team feedback

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands AI-specific architectural considerations
- [ ] Clear patterns for building scalable AI applications
- [ ] Working example demonstrates best practices
- [ ] Architecture templates created for projects

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 6.1
- AWS/Azure AI architecture references
- Microservices patterns documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on practical production patterns
- Discuss reliability, latency, and cost trade-offs
- Show real architecture from ATG projects if available
- Connect to Category 7 (MLOps) for deployment
