---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 8: Data Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 8.3 Dataset Preparation  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Prepare high-quality datasets for AI/ML training
2. Implement data annotation and labeling workflows
3. Create proper train/validation/test splits

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Data Annotation & Labeling:** Tools, workflows, quality control, inter-annotator agreement
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** When and how to generate synthetic data
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques for increasing dataset size and diversity
- **Train/Val/Test Splits:** Proper splitting strategies, stratification, time-based splits

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides on dataset preparation best practices
- Include annotation workflow diagrams
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build data annotation and validation workflow
- Demonstrate data augmentation techniques
- Show proper dataset splitting methods

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on dataset preparation
- Create annotation guidelines template
- Share code for augmentation and splitting

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we ensure annotation quality?"
  - "When should we use synthetic data?"
