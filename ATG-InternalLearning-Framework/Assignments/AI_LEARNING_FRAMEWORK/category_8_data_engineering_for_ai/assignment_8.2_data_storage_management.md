# Lesson Plan Assignment: Data Storage & Management

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 8: Data Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 8.2 Data Storage & Management  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Choose appropriate database solutions for AI applications
2. Understand data lake vs data warehouse trade-offs
3. Implement data versioning and lineage tracking

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Database Choices:** SQL vs NoSQL, vector databases, graph databases for AI
- **Data Lake vs Warehouse:** Use cases, architecture, when to use each
- **Versioning & Lineage:** Data versioning, lineage tracking, reproducibility
- **Privacy & Security:** Encryption, access control, PII protection

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides comparing storage options for AI
- Include decision matrix for database selection
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Set up different database types for AI use cases
- Demonstrate data versioning and lineage
- Show access control and security measures

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on data storage for AI
- Create database selection guide
- Share configuration examples and best practices

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What storage architecture fits our data needs?"
  - "How do we track data lineage in our systems?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study storage solutions (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3, etc.)
- **Practice:** Set up and compare different storage options
- **Collaborate:** One covers architecture, other demonstrates implementation
- **Engage:** Design storage solution for real project
