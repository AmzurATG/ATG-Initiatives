# Lesson Plan Assignment: Data Pipelines

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 8: Data Engineering for AI  
**Subcategory:** 8.1 Data Pipelines  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Design and implement data collection and ingestion pipelines
2. Build ETL/ELT processes for AI systems
3. Ensure data quality and validation throughout pipelines

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Data Collection & Ingestion:** APIs, webhooks, batch uploads, streaming ingestion
- **ETL/ELT for AI:** Extract, transform, load patterns for ML data
- **Data Quality & Validation:** Schema validation, data quality checks, anomaly detection
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Airflow, Prefect, scheduling, dependencies

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides showing data pipeline architecture
- Include ETL vs ELT comparison
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build end-to-end data pipeline for AI application
- Demonstrate data validation and quality checks
- Show pipeline orchestration and monitoring

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on data engineering for AI
- Create pipeline design patterns library
- Share code templates for common pipelines

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we ensure data quality for our AI systems?"
  - "What orchestration tool should we use?"
