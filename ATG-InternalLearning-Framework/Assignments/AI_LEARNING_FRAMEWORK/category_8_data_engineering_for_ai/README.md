## Notes

- Data engineering is foundational for AI success
- Recommended order: 8.2 → 8.1 → 8.3 (storage → pipelines → preparation)
- Quality data leads to quality AI systems
- These practices prevent common data-related issues
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- 8.1 connects to Category 7 (MLOps) for production pipelines
- 8.2 builds on Category 4.2 (Vector Databases)
- 8.3 is essential for Category 3.3 (Fine-tuning)
- All AI applications depend on good data engineering
