# Lesson Plan Assignment: LangChain Ecosystem

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 5: Agent Frameworks & Orchestration  
**Subcategory:** 5.1 LangChain Ecosystem  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand LangChain's core concepts and architecture
2. Build chains, agents, and use tools within LangChain
3. Implement memory management for conversational applications

---

## Topics to Cover

- **LangChain Core Concepts:** Chains, prompts, output parsers, runnables
- **Chains, Agents & Tools:** Sequential chains, agent types, custom tools, tool calling
- **Memory Management:** Conversation memory, buffer memory, summary memory
- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):** Composing chains, parallel execution, streaming

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining LangChain architecture and components
- Include examples of chains vs agents and when to use each
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a simple chain (e.g., summarization or Q&A chain)
- Demonstrate an agent with custom tools
- Show conversation memory in a chatbot

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (LangChain docs, tutorials, examples)
- Create quick reference guide for common LangChain patterns
- Share code templates for chains, agents, and memory

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "When should we use LangChain vs building from scratch?"
  - "What are the trade-offs of framework abstraction?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Explore LangChain documentation and example applications
- **Practice:** Build multiple examples to understand different components
- **Collaborate:** One covers chains/prompts, other demonstrates agents/tools
- **Engage:** Live coding session building a chain from scratch

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands LangChain's role in AI application development
- [ ] Clear examples of chains, agents, and tools
- [ ] Working demos show practical use cases
- [ ] Memory management concepts demonstrated
- [ ] Team can start building with LangChain immediately

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 5.1
- LangChain official documentation
- LangChain cookbook and examples
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on practical patterns over comprehensive API coverage
- Discuss when LangChain adds value vs adds complexity
- Show real project examples if available
- This is foundational for 5.2 (LangGraph) and other agent topics
