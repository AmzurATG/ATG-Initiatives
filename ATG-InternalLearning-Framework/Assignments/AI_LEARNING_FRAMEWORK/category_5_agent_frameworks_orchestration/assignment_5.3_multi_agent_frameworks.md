# Lesson Plan Assignment: Multi-Agent Frameworks

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 5: Agent Frameworks & Orchestration  
**Subcategory:** 5.3 Multi-Agent Frameworks  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand multi-agent architectures and coordination patterns
2. Work with CrewAI and AutoGen frameworks
3. Identify appropriate use cases for multi-agent systems

---

## Topics to Cover

- **CrewAI Concepts:** Crews, agents, tasks, roles, collaboration patterns
- **AutoGen Framework:** Agent types, conversation patterns, group chat
- **Agent Coordination:** Communication, delegation, consensus, specialization
- **Multi-Agent Use Cases:** Research, analysis, software development, problem-solving

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides comparing single-agent vs multi-agent approaches
- Include architecture diagrams for multi-agent coordination
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a multi-agent system using CrewAI or AutoGen
- Demonstrate agent collaboration on a complex task
- Show different agent roles and specializations

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (CrewAI, AutoGen docs, research papers)
- Create comparison: CrewAI vs AutoGen vs custom implementations
- Share multi-agent patterns and architectures

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "When is the complexity of multi-agent worth it?"
  - "How do we ensure agent coordination doesn't fail?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Explore CrewAI and AutoGen documentation and examples
- **Practice:** Build multi-agent system with 2-3 specialized agents
- **Collaborate:** One covers CrewAI, other demonstrates AutoGen
- **Engage:** Live demo showing agents collaborating on task

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands multi-agent concepts and benefits
- [ ] Clear comparison of available frameworks
- [ ] Working demo shows meaningful agent collaboration
- [ ] Use cases identified for multi-agent approaches
- [ ] Team can evaluate when to use multi-agent systems

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 5.3
- CrewAI documentation and examples
- Microsoft AutoGen documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on practical benefits over hype
- Discuss coordination challenges and failure modes
- Show real-world use cases (research, coding, analysis)
- Multi-agent is powerful but adds complexity - be balanced
