## Notes

- Agent frameworks are critical for building sophisticated AI applications
- Recommended order: 5.1 → 5.4 → 5.2 → 5.3 (fundamentals → patterns → advanced)
- 5.1 (LangChain) is foundational for most agent work
- 5.4 (Patterns) provides reusable approaches for common scenarios
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- 5.1 builds on Category 2 (LLMs) and Category 4 (RAG)
- 5.4 patterns are used throughout 5.1-5.3 implementations
- Agent frameworks often integrate RAG (Category 4)
- These topics lead to production systems (Category 7 - MLOps)

---

## Practical Importance

Agent frameworks enable:
- Complex task automation
- Research and analysis systems
- Code generation and review
- Autonomous problem-solving

LangChain is currently the most popular framework, making 5.1 especially important.
