# Lesson Plan Assignment: LangGraph

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 5: Agent Frameworks & Orchestration  
**Subcategory:** 5.2 LangGraph  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand state machines and graph-based workflows for agents
2. Implement branching and decision logic in agent workflows
3. Build human-in-the-loop patterns for agent oversight

---

## Topics to Cover

- **State Machines:** Graph-based agent execution, nodes, edges, state management
- **Graph Workflows:** Designing workflows, conditional edges, cycles
- **Branching & Decision Logic:** Routing based on state, dynamic paths
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Approval steps, interrupt patterns, human feedback integration

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining LangGraph concepts with visual workflow diagrams
- Include comparison: LangChain chains vs LangGraph workflows
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build a multi-step agent workflow with LangGraph
- Demonstrate conditional branching based on intermediate results
- Show human-in-the-loop approval pattern

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (LangGraph docs, examples, tutorials)
- Create workflow patterns library (approval, retry, parallel)
- Share code templates for common graph structures

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "When do we need LangGraph vs simple LangChain chains?"
  - "How do we handle errors and retries in complex workflows?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study LangGraph documentation and example workflows
- **Practice:** Build workflows with different branching patterns
- **Collaborate:** One covers graph concepts, other demonstrates implementation
- **Engage:** Visualize workflow execution step-by-step

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands state machine concepts for agents
- [ ] Clear explanation of when LangGraph is beneficial
- [ ] Working workflow demonstrates branching and decisions
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop pattern implemented
- [ ] Workflow patterns library created for team use
