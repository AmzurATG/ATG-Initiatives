# Lesson Plan Assignment: Agent Design Patterns

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 5: Agent Frameworks & Orchestration  
**Subcategory:** 5.4 Agent Design Patterns  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand and implement the ReAct pattern for agent reasoning
2. Apply plan-and-execute patterns for complex tasks
3. Build agents with reflection and self-correction capabilities

---

## Topics to Cover

- **ReAct Pattern:** Reasoning + Acting, thought-action-observation loop
- **Plan-and-Execute:** Planning step, execution step, replanning strategies
- **Reflection & Self-Correction:** Agent self-evaluation, error recovery, iterative improvement
- **Tool Use & Function Calling:** Tool selection, parameter extraction, result interpretation

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining each pattern with workflow diagrams
- Include when to use each pattern and trade-offs
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Implement ReAct pattern agent solving a problem
- Demonstrate plan-and-execute pattern with replanning
- Show reflection/self-correction improving agent output

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (papers, implementations, tutorials)
- Create pattern selection guide for different task types
- Share code templates for each pattern

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which pattern fits our current agent use cases?"
  - "How do we balance reasoning steps with cost/latency?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study ReAct paper and pattern implementations
- **Practice:** Implement each pattern with concrete examples
- **Collaborate:** Split patterns between team members
- **Engage:** Show pattern comparison on same task

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands key agent design patterns
- [ ] Each pattern demonstrated with working code
- [ ] Clear guidance on pattern selection for tasks
- [ ] Tool use and function calling explained
- [ ] Pattern library created for team projects

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 5.4
- ReAct paper and implementations
- LangChain agent documentation
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Show concrete examples of each pattern in action
- Discuss cost implications (multiple LLM calls)
- Emphasize debugging and observability
- These patterns are used throughout Categories 5.1-5.3
