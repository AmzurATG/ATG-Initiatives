---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 7: MLOps & Production Systems  
**Subcategory:** 7.3 Monitoring & Observability  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring for AI systems
2. Detect and respond to model drift
3. Set up effective logging and debugging for production AI

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Performance Monitoring:** Latency, throughput, error rates, SLA tracking
- **Model Drift Detection:** Data drift, concept drift, detection methods
- **Logging & Debugging:** Structured logging, request tracing, production debugging
- **Cost Tracking:** Token usage, API costs, optimization opportunities

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides on monitoring strategy for AI systems
- Include dashboard examples and alerting strategies
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Set up monitoring dashboard for AI application
- Demonstrate drift detection and alerting
- Show cost tracking and analysis

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on AI observability
- Create monitoring checklist and metrics guide
- Share dashboard templates and alerting rules

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What metrics should we monitor for our AI systems?"
  - "How do we detect when models need retraining?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, LangSmith)
- **Practice:** Set up full monitoring stack
- **Collaborate:** One covers monitoring, other demonstrates drift detection
- **Engage:** Show real production issues and how monitoring helped
