## Notes

- MLOps is critical for taking AI from prototype to production
- Recommended order: 7.1 → 7.2 → 7.3 → 7.4 (lifecycle to deployment to monitoring)
- These practices prevent common production failures
- Each topic builds on previous ones
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

---

## Integration Notes

- 7.1 builds on all previous categories (1-6)
- 7.2 and 7.3 are essential for production reliability
- 7.4 connects to security topics in Category 10.3
- MLOps practices apply to all AI applications

---

## Practical Importance

MLOps bridges the gap between:
- Experimentation and production
- Data scientists and engineers
- Proof-of-concept and scalable systems

Essential for production AI success.
