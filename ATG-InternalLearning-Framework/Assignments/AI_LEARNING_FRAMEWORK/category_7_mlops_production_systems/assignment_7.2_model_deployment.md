# Lesson Plan Assignment: Model Deployment

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 7: MLOps & Production Systems  
**Subcategory:** 7.2 Model Deployment  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand different deployment strategies for AI models
2. Set up serving infrastructure for production models
3. Implement A/B testing and canary deployments

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Deployment Strategies:** Blue-green, canary, rolling deployments
- **Serving Infrastructure:** Model servers, APIs, containers, serverless
- **Model Optimization:** Quantization, pruning, distillation for production
- **A/B Testing:** Comparing model versions, statistical significance, rollback

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining deployment strategies with diagrams
- Include infrastructure options and trade-offs
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Deploy a model with proper serving infrastructure
- Demonstrate canary deployment or A/B testing
- Show model optimization techniques

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on model deployment
- Create deployment checklist and runbook template
- Share infrastructure-as-code examples

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What deployment strategy fits our use cases?"
  - "How do we safely roll out new model versions?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study deployment platforms (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, etc.)
- **Practice:** Deploy model with different strategies
- **Collaborate:** One covers strategies, other demonstrates deployment
- **Engage:** Live deployment with monitoring

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands deployment strategies and when to use each
- [ ] Working deployment demonstrated
- [ ] A/B testing or canary deployment shown
- [ ] Deployment checklist created
- [ ] Team can deploy models safely to production

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 7.2
- AWS SageMaker, Azure ML documentation
- Docker, Kubernetes resources
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on safety and reliability
- Discuss rollback procedures
- Show cost implications of different approaches
- Connect to 7.3 (Monitoring) for production observability
