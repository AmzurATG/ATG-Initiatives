# Lesson Plan Assignment: MLOps Fundamentals

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 7: MLOps & Production Systems  
**Subcategory:** 7.1 MLOps Fundamentals  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand the MLOps lifecycle and its importance
2. Implement model versioning and tracking strategies
3. Use experiment management tools effectively

---

## Topics to Cover

- **MLOps Lifecycle:** Training, deployment, monitoring, retraining - continuous cycle
- **Model Versioning:** Git for code, versioning for models and datasets
- **Experiment Management:** Tracking experiments, parameters, metrics (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- **CI/CD for ML:** Automated testing, model validation, deployment pipelines

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining MLOps lifecycle with diagrams
- Include comparison: traditional DevOps vs MLOps
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Set up experiment tracking with MLflow or W&B
- Demonstrate model versioning and comparison
- Show CI/CD pipeline for ML model

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on MLOps best practices
- Create MLOps checklist for projects
- Share tools comparison (MLflow, W&B, Neptune)

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "What MLOps practices should we adopt immediately?"
  - "How do we track experiments across the team?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Study MLOps platforms and best practices
- **Practice:** Set up experiment tracking and model registry
- **Collaborate:** One covers lifecycle/theory, other demonstrates tools
- **Engage:** Walk through real model deployment scenario

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands MLOps lifecycle and principles
- [ ] Experiment tracking system demonstrated
- [ ] Model versioning strategy defined
- [ ] CI/CD basics for ML explained
- [ ] MLOps tooling recommendations provided

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 7.1
- MLflow, Weights & Biases documentation
- MLOps community best practices
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- Focus on practical MLOps for LLM applications
- Don't overcomplicate - start with basics
- Show how MLOps prevents common production issues
- This is foundational for production AI systems
