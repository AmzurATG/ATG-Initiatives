# Lesson Plan Assignment: Multimodal AI

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 3: Generative AI  
**Subcategory:** 3.2 Multimodal AI  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand capabilities of vision-language models and their applications
2. Work with image generation models and their parameters
3. Implement basic multimodal AI workflows (text+image, audio processing)

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Vision-Language Models:** GPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini - image understanding and analysis
- **Image Generation:** DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion - concepts and techniques
- **Audio & Speech:** Whisper for transcription, text-to-speech models
- **Document Understanding:** PDF/image to structured data extraction

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides showcasing multimodal capabilities with real examples
- Include use cases and limitations for each modality
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build an image analysis application using vision-language models
- Demonstrate document extraction (invoice, receipt, or resume parsing)
- Show audio transcription and processing example

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on multimodal AI applications
- Create use case matrix: which model for which task
- Share prompt templates for vision tasks

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How can multimodal AI enhance our current projects?"
  - "What are the cost implications of using vision models?"
