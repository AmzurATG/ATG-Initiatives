## Notes

- These topics cover the breadth of generative AI capabilities
- Recommended order: 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 (generation basics → multimodal → customization)
- 3.3 should be compared with Category 4 (RAG) for decision-making
- Multimodal AI (3.2) opens up many new use case opportunities
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)

## Integration Notes

- 3.1 builds directly on Category 2.3 (Prompt Engineering)
- 3.3 compares with Category 4 (RAG) - important decision point
- 3.2 expands possibilities beyond text-only applications
