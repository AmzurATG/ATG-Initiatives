# Lesson Plan Assignment: Text Generation

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 3: Generative AI  
**Subcategory:** 3.1 Text Generation  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Understand different text generation techniques and parameters
2. Implement controlled text generation with specific constraints
3. Distinguish between text completion and chat models and their use cases

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Generation Techniques:** Greedy search, beam search, sampling methods (top-k, top-p/nucleus)
- **Controlled Generation:** Temperature, max tokens, stop sequences, frequency/presence penalties
- **Completion vs Chat Models:** Use cases, API differences, conversation management
- **Quality & Consistency:** Determinism, reproducibility, output validation

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides explaining generation parameters with visual examples
- Include comparison of different sampling strategies
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Build examples showing impact of temperature, top_p, and other parameters
- Demonstrate both completion and chat model usage
- Create a text generation playground with adjustable parameters

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources on text generation techniques
- Create a parameter tuning guide with recommendations
- Share code templates for common generation patterns

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "How do we ensure consistent outputs in production?"
  - "When should we use completion vs chat models?"
