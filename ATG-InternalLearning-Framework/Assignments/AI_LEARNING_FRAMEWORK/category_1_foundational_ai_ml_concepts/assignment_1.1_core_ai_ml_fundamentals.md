# Lesson Plan Assignment: Core AI/ML Fundamentals

---

## Assignment Information

**Category:** Category 1: Foundational AI & ML Concepts  
**Subcategory:** 1.1 Core AI/ML Fundamentals  
**Assigned To:** [Team Member 1 & Team Member 2]  
**Presentation Date:** [Date]  
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, team members should be able to:
1. Define key AI/ML terminology and explain differences between AI, ML, and Deep Learning
2. Identify and describe different types of learning paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
3. Understand the model training lifecycle and key evaluation metrics

---

## Topics to Cover

- **Basic Terminology:** AI vs ML vs Deep Learning, features, labels, training, inference
- **Learning Paradigms:** Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning
- **Model Training:** Training process, overfitting/underfitting, validation strategies
- **Common Algorithms:** Overview of classification, regression, clustering algorithms

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create a slide deck with clear definitions and visual diagrams
- Include a comparison chart of learning paradigms with examples
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Implement a simple supervised learning example (e.g., classification or regression)
- Show training, evaluation, and prediction steps
- Use scikit-learn or similar library with commented code

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 beginner-friendly resources (videos, articles, tutorials)
- Create a glossary of 10-15 essential AI/ML terms
- Share a "cheat sheet" comparing different algorithms

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Which learning paradigm fits our current project needs?"
  - "How do we know if a model is performing well?"

---

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Research:** Start with scikit-learn documentation and Google's ML crash course
- **Practice:** Run multiple examples to understand concepts hands-on
- **Collaborate:** One person covers theory, other demonstrates practical examples
- **Engage:** Use real-world examples the team can relate to

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Team understands core AI/ML terminology and concepts
- [ ] Clear distinction between different learning paradigms
- [ ] Working code example demonstrates the ML workflow
- [ ] Team can identify which approach fits different problems
- [ ] Glossary and resources shared for future reference

---

## Support & Resources

- Reference: AI_Learning_Framework.md - Category 1.1
- Scikit-learn tutorials and documentation
- Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course materials
- Share draft materials 2 days before presentation

---

## Notes

- This is foundational - ensure everyone has the same baseline understanding
- Use simple datasets (Iris, Boston Housing, etc.)
- Avoid complex mathematics - focus on intuition
- Record session as reference for new team members
