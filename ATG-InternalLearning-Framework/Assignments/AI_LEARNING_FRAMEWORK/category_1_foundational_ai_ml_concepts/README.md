## Notes

- These are foundational topics that should be covered early in the learning journey
- All three subcategories build upon each other
- Recommended order: 1.1 → 1.3 → 1.2 (math before deep learning)
- Each assignment follows the lesson_plan_template.md structure
- Duration: 30-45 minutes per session (20-30 min presentation + 10-15 min Q&A)
