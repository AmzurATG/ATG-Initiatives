## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (Required)
- Create slides with clear visual explanations of math concepts
- Use real ML examples to illustrate each mathematical concept
- Duration: 20-30 minutes

### 2. Code Demo/Example (Required)
- Demonstrate data preprocessing pipeline with pandas/numpy
- Show impact of normalization on model performance
- Visualize distributions and statistical properties of data

### 3. Resources & References (Required)
- Curate 3-5 resources (Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown, StatQuest videos)
- Create a "Math for ML" cheat sheet with key formulas
- Share Python notebooks with reusable preprocessing functions

### 4. Q&A Session (Required)
- Prepare for 10-15 minutes of questions
- Discussion questions:
  - "Why does normalization improve model performance?"
  - "How do we identify and handle outliers in our data?"
