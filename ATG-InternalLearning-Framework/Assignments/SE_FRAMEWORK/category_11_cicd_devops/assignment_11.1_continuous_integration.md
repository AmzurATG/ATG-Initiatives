- Matrix builds (multiple versions)
- Build reproducibility

### 3. Automated Testing in CI
- Running unit tests
- Integration test execution
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Security scanning
- Test result reporting
- Fail fast principles

### 4. CI Pipeline Design
- Pipeline stages and jobs
- Parallel vs sequential execution
- Pipeline triggers (push, PR, schedule)
- Environment variables and secrets
- Pipeline as code
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
