- A/B testing in production
- Strategy selection criteria

### 3. Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback triggers
- Database migration rollback
- State management in rollbacks
- Testing rollback procedures
- Rollback vs roll-forward
- Communication during rollback

### 4. Zero-Downtime Deployments
- Load balancer management
