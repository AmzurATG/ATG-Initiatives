# Assignment 6.1: Creational Patterns

## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Design Patterns
- **Sub-category**: 6.1 Creational Patterns
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand Singleton, Factory, and Abstract Factory patterns
2. Implement the Builder pattern for complex object creation
3. Apply the Prototype pattern for object cloning
4. Select the appropriate creational pattern for different scenarios

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory
- Singleton: single instance control
- Factory Method: defer instantiation to subclasses
- Abstract Factory: families of related objects
- When to use each pattern
- Anti-patterns and pitfalls

### 2. Builder Pattern
- Step-by-step object construction
- Fluent interface design
- Director vs Builder
- Handling optional parameters
- Immutability with builders

### 3. Prototype Pattern
- Cloning existing objects
- Shallow vs deep copy
- Clone method implementation
- Performance benefits
- Use cases and limitations

### 4. Pattern Selection
- Problem-pattern mapping
- Combining creational patterns
- Trade-offs and complexity
- Modern language features vs patterns
- Dependency injection considerations

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (20-30 minutes)
- Each creational pattern explained with diagrams
- Real-world use cases from software systems
- Pattern comparison and selection guide
- Common mistakes and anti-patterns
- Modern alternatives to classic patterns

### 2. Code Demo/Example
- Implement each creational pattern
- Show Singleton thread-safety issues
- Demonstrate Builder fluent interface
- Create Factory hierarchy
- Prototype cloning example
- Compare approaches for same problem

### 3. Resources & References (Provide 3-5 curated)
- Gang of Four Design Patterns book
- Refactoring.guru design patterns
- Language-specific pattern implementations
- Modern pattern alternatives
- Design pattern catalogs

### 4. Q&A Session (10-15 minutes)
- Prepare for questions about Singleton anti-pattern
- Dependency injection vs Factory
- Builder vs constructor overloading
- Pattern overhead in simple scenarios
- Testing with design patterns

---

## Preparation Guidelines

### Research
- Study GoF creational patterns
- Review pattern implementations in frameworks
- Understand pattern trade-offs
- Learn modern alternatives

### Practice
- Implement all creational patterns
- Refactor code to use patterns
- Compare pattern vs non-pattern solutions
- Build real-world examples
- Write tests for pattern implementations

### Collaboration
- Identify patterns in ATG codebase
- Discuss pattern usage decisions
- Share pattern success stories
- Review pattern opportunities

### Engagement
- Live pattern implementation
- Interactive: identify the pattern
- Group exercise: select pattern for scenario
- Show framework pattern usage

---
