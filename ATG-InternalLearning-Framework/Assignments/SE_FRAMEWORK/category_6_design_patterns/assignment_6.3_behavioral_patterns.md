# Assignment 6.3: Behavioral Patterns

## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Design Patterns
- **Sub-category**: 6.3 Behavioral Patterns
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand Strategy, Observer, and Command patterns
2. Implement Chain of Responsibility for request handling
3. Apply Template Method for algorithm skeletons
4. Use State and Mediator patterns for complex behaviors

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Strategy, Observer, Command
- Strategy: interchangeable algorithms
- Observer: one-to-many dependency (pub-sub)
- Command: encapsulate requests as objects
- Real-world applications
- Event-driven programming with Observer

### 2. Chain of Responsibility
- Request handling chain
- Middleware pattern
- Logging, authentication, validation chains
- Short-circuiting vs full chain
- Flexible request processing

### 3. Template Method
- Algorithm skeleton in base class
- Hook methods for customization
- Hollywood Principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you"
- Abstract classes vs interfaces
- Testing template methods

### 4. State and Mediator Patterns
- State: object behavior based on internal state
- State machines and transitions
- Mediator: reduce coupling between objects
- Centralized communication
- Use cases in UI and workflow systems
