# Assignment 6.2: Structural Patterns

## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Design Patterns
- **Sub-category**: 6.2 Structural Patterns
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand Adapter, Bridge, and Composite patterns
2. Implement Decorator pattern for extending functionality
3. Apply Facade pattern to simplify complex subsystems
4. Use Proxy pattern for controlled object access

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Adapter, Bridge, Composite
- Adapter: convert interfaces
- Bridge: separate abstraction from implementation
- Composite: tree structures and uniform treatment
- Use cases and examples
- Similarities and differences

### 2. Decorator Pattern
- Add responsibilities dynamically
- Wrapper classes
- Decorator vs inheritance
- Multiple decorators
- Real-world examples (I/O streams, middleware)

### 3. Facade Pattern
- Simplify complex subsystems
- Unified interface
- Reduce coupling
- API gateway as Facade
- When Facade becomes anti-pattern

### 4. Proxy Pattern
- Control access to objects
- Virtual proxy (lazy loading)
- Protection proxy (access control)
- Remote proxy (network communication)
- Smart references and caching

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (20-30 minutes)
- Each structural pattern with diagrams
- Real-world examples from popular frameworks
- Pattern comparison and relationships
- Common use cases in web applications
- Anti-patterns and pitfalls

### 2. Code Demo/Example
- Implement each structural pattern
- Adapter for third-party library integration
- Decorator chain example
- Facade for complex API
- Proxy for lazy loading
- Show pattern combinations

### 3. Resources & References (Provide 3-5 curated)
- Design Patterns book structural section
- Refactoring.guru structural patterns
- Framework examples (Spring, Express, etc.)
- Pattern implementation videos
- Real-world usage examples

### 4. Q&A Session (10-15 minutes)
- Prepare for questions about Decorator vs inheritance
- Adapter vs Bridge differences
- Facade complexity growth
- Proxy performance overhead
- Combining structural patterns

---

## Preparation Guidelines

### Research
- Study each structural pattern

### Collaboration
- Identify structural patterns in ATG code
- Discuss adapter usage for integrations
- Review facade opportunities
- Share pattern experiences

### Engagement
