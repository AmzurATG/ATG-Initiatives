## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Logging & Monitoring
- **Sub-category**: 9.4 Observability
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, traces
2. Distinguish between observability and monitoring
3. Implement OpenTelemetry for comprehensive observability
4. Debug production issues using observability tools

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Three Pillars: Logs, Metrics, Traces
- Logs for detailed events
- Metrics for aggregated data
- Traces for request flows
- Correlation between pillars
- When to use each
- Unified observability platforms

### 2. Observability vs Monitoring
- Monitoring: known unknowns
- Observability: unknown unknowns
- Cardinality and high-dimensionality
- Asking new questions of old data
- Exploratory investigation
- Proactive vs reactive approaches

### 3. OpenTelemetry Concepts
- Unified observability framework
- Auto-instrumentation
- Semantic conventions
- Exporters and collectors
- Vendor-agnostic approach
- Migration from proprietary agents

### 4. Debugging Production Issues
- Using observability for troubleshooting
- Following request traces
- Correlating logs and metrics
- Analyzing anomalies
- Performance investigation
- Post-incident analysis
