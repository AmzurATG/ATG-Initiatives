- **Category**: Logging & Monitoring
- **Sub-category**: 9.3 Application Monitoring
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Define and track appropriate metrics and KPIs
2. Implement health checks and heartbeats
3. Design effective alerting strategies
4. Create useful monitoring dashboards

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Metrics and KPIs
- Application metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
- Business metrics (conversion, user engagement)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- RED method (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- USE method (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)

### 2. Health Checks and Heartbeats
- Liveness vs readiness probes
- Deep vs shallow health checks
- Health check endpoints
- Dependency health
- Graceful degradation indicators
- Kubernetes health checks

### 3. Alerting Strategies
- Alert fatigue prevention
- Alert severity levels
- On-call rotation
- Runbook documentation
- Alert escalation
- SLA/SLO based alerting

### 4. Dashboard Design
- Key metrics visualization
- Dashboard for different audiences
- Real-time vs historical views
- Alert status display
- Service dependency maps
- Mobile-friendly dashboards
