## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Recognize when and how to refactor code effectively
2. Identify common code smells that indicate need for refactoring
3. Apply specific refactoring patterns safely
4. Manage technical debt strategically

## Topics to Cover

### 1. When and How to Refactor
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Refactoring during development vs dedicated time
- Small, incremental refactorings
- Safety nets: tests before refactoring
- Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it

### 2. Code Smells Identification
- Long methods and large classes
- Duplicate code
- Long parameter lists
- Divergent change and shotgun surgery
- Feature envy and data clumps
- Primitive obsession and refused bequest

### 3. Refactoring Patterns
- Extract Method/Function
- Rename Variable/Method
- Introduce Parameter Object
- Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
- Move Method/Field
- Extract Class
- Inline Method

### 4. Technical Debt Management
- Identifying technical debt
- Measuring and tracking debt
- Prioritizing debt repayment
- Communicating debt to stakeholders
- Preventing debt accumulation
- Strategic vs tactical debt
