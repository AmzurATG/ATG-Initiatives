## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand caching concepts and benefits
2. Implement different caching layers
3. Design cache invalidation strategies
4. Choose appropriate caching technologies

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Caching Concepts
- Cache hit vs cache miss
- Cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- TTL (Time To Live)
- Cache warming
- Cache-aside vs read-through
- Write-through vs write-behind

### 2. Caching Layers
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- HTTP caching (CDN, browser)
- Distributed caching (Redis, Memcached)
- In-memory caching
- Edge caching

### 3. Cache Invalidation
- Time-based invalidation
- Event-based invalidation
- Cache stampede prevention
- Cache coherence
- Invalidation complexity
- Partial vs full invalidation

### 4. Caching Technologies
- Redis features and use cases
- Memcached characteristics
- CDN providers (CloudFlare, Akamai)
- Browser caching mechanisms
- Application frameworks caching
- Technology selection criteria
