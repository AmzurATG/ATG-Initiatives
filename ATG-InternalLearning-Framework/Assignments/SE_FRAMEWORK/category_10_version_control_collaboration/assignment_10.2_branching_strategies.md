## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand GitFlow workflow and its application
2. Implement GitHub Flow for continuous delivery
3. Apply trunk-based development practices
4. Select appropriate branching strategy for different projects

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. GitFlow Workflow
- Main, develop, feature, release, hotfix branches
- When to create each branch type
- Branch naming conventions
- Release management
- Hotfix procedures
- Best for scheduled releases

### 2. GitHub Flow
- Main branch always deployable
- Feature branches for work
- Pull requests for review
- Immediate deployment
- Simplified workflow
- Best for continuous deployment

### 3. Trunk-Based Development
- Short-lived feature branches
- Frequent integration to trunk
- Feature flags for incomplete work
- Continuous integration focus
- Scaling with code reviews
- Best for high-velocity teams

### 4. Strategy Selection
- Team size considerations
- Release frequency
- Deployment pipeline maturity
- Risk tolerance
- Hybrid approaches
- Migration strategies
