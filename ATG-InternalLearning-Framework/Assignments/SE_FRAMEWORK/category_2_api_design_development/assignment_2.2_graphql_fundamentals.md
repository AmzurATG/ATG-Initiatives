# Assignment 2.2: GraphQL Fundamentals

## Assignment Information
- **Category**: API Design & Development
- **Sub-category**: 2.2 GraphQL Fundamentals
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand GraphQL vs REST comparison and when to use each
2. Design GraphQL schemas with proper types, queries, and mutations
3. Implement resolvers to fetch and manipulate data
4. Recognize and address GraphQL performance considerations

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. GraphQL vs REST Comparison
- Single endpoint vs multiple endpoints
- Over-fetching and under-fetching problems
- Strongly typed schema
- Client-specified queries
- When GraphQL makes sense vs REST
- Hybrid approaches

### 2. Schema Design and Types
- Schema Definition Language (SDL)
- Scalar types, Object types, Enums
- Input types and interfaces
- Nullable vs non-nullable fields
- Schema design best practices
- Schema evolution and versioning

### 3. Queries, Mutations, and Subscriptions
- Query structure and syntax
- Arguments and variables
- Mutations for data modifications
- Subscriptions for real-time updates
- Fragments for reusable queries
- Aliases and inline fragments

### 4. Resolvers and Performance
- Resolver function implementation
- N+1 query problem in GraphQL
- DataLoader pattern for batching
- Query complexity analysis
- Depth limiting and query cost
- Caching strategies

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (20-30 minutes)
- GraphQL overview with architecture diagrams
- Side-by-side REST vs GraphQL comparison
- Schema design walkthrough with examples
- Performance considerations and solutions
- Real-world use cases and anti-patterns

### 2. Code Demo/Example
- Build a GraphQL API (blog posts, comments, users)
- Implement queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Show resolver implementation with DataLoader
- Demonstrate GraphQL playground/GraphiQL
- Compare same feature in REST vs GraphQL

### 3. Resources & References (Provide 3-5 curated)
- Official GraphQL documentation
- Apollo or other GraphQL framework guides
- Schema design best practices
- Performance optimization articles
- Sample projects on GitHub

### 4. Q&A Session (10-15 minutes)
- Prepare for questions about REST vs GraphQL trade-offs
- File uploads in GraphQL
- Authentication and authorization
- Tooling and ecosystem maturity
- Migration from REST to GraphQL

---

## Preparation Guidelines

### Research
- Study GraphQL specification and concepts
- Review well-designed GraphQL APIs (GitHub, Shopify)
- Understand resolver chains and execution
- Learn about GraphQL tooling ecosystem

### Practice
- Build a complete GraphQL API from scratch
- Implement queries and mutations
- Add authentication and authorization
- Optimize with DataLoader
- Set up GraphQL playground

### Collaboration
- Discuss whether any ATG projects could benefit from GraphQL
- Compare with existing REST APIs
- Identify potential migration candidates
- Review client requirements for flexible queries

### Engagement
- Live schema design exercise
- Interactive query building in GraphQL playground
- Performance comparison demo
- Group discussion on use cases

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear explanation of GraphQL concepts and advantages
- [ ] Working GraphQL API with queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- [ ] Understanding of schema design best practices
- [ ] Recognition of performance pitfalls and solutions
- [ ] Team can make informed decisions between REST and GraphQL

---

## Support & Resources
- Reference the lesson_plan_template.md for structure
- Consult with teams using GraphQL
- Review GraphQL frameworks (Apollo, Relay, etc.)
- Software Engineering Excellence Framework document

---

## Notes
- Builds on REST knowledge from Assignment 2.1
- Connect to API security concepts (Assignment 2.3)
- GraphQL is not a replacement for REST, it's an alternative
- Consider complexity cost vs flexibility benefits
- Discuss how AI assistants handle GraphQL code generation
- Relate to frontend requirements and development efficiency
