- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Recognize common testing mistakes and anti-patterns
2. Address test maintenance challenges effectively
3. Balance testing efforts appropriately
4. Manage test data strategically

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Common Testing Mistakes
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- Fragile tests coupled to code structure
- Testing private methods
- Not testing edge cases
- Ignoring test failures
- Copy-paste test code
- Testing the framework instead of your code

### 2. Test Maintenance Challenges
- Tests breaking with every refactoring
- Hard-to-understand test code
- Slow test execution
- Test code duplication
- Outdated tests
- Missing test documentation
- Technical debt in test code

### 3. Over-Testing vs Under-Testing
- Diminishing returns of 100% coverage
- Critical path identification
- Risk-based testing approach
- Testing happy path vs edge cases
- When not to write tests
- Balancing speed and quality

### 4. Test Data Management
- Hard-coded test data problems
- Shared mutable state
- Test data builders
- Factories and fixtures
- Database seeding strategies
- Test data isolation
- Sensitive data in tests

---
