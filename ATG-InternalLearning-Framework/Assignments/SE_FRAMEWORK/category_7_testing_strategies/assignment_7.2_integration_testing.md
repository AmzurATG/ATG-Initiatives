## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Testing Strategies
- **Sub-category**: 7.2 Integration Testing
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Design effective integration test strategies
2. Implement database testing approaches
3. Test APIs and external integrations
4. Handle test dependencies and isolation

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Integration Test Strategies
- Testing module interactions
- Big Bang vs incremental integration
- Top-down vs bottom-up testing
- Test pyramid: unit, integration, E2E
- Scope and boundaries of integration tests

### 2. Database Testing Approaches
- In-memory databases for testing
- Test containers (Testcontainers)
- Database fixtures and seed data
- Transaction rollback for isolation
- Testing migrations
- Database performance testing

### 3. API Testing
- REST API testing tools (Postman, REST-assured)
- Testing request/response contracts
- Testing authentication and authorization
- Testing error scenarios
- API versioning testing
- Mock servers and service virtualization

### 4. Testing External Dependencies
- Third-party API testing
- Service mocking and stubbing
- Contract testing (Pact)
- Testing timeout and failure scenarios
- Rate limiting testing
- Integration test environments
