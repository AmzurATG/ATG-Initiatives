# Assignment 7.1: Unit Testing

## Assignment Information
- **Category**: Testing Strategies
- **Sub-category**: 7.1 Unit Testing
- **Team Members**: [Pair names to be assigned]
- **Presentation Date**: [To be scheduled]
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand unit testing principles and best practices
2. Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
3. Implement mocking and stubbing for isolated tests
4. Measure and interpret test coverage metrics

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Unit Test Principles and Best Practices
- FIRST principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely)
- Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- One assertion per test vs multiple assertions
- Test naming conventions
- Test organization and structure

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Writing tests before code
- Benefits and challenges of TDD
- TDD vs test-after development
- When TDD makes sense
- TDD katas and practice

### 3. Mocking and Stubbing
- Test doubles: mocks, stubs, fakes, spies
- When to use each type
- Mocking frameworks (Jest, Mockito, Moq, unittest.mock)
- Over-mocking anti-pattern
- Testing external dependencies

### 4. Test Coverage and Metrics
- Line coverage vs branch coverage
- Coverage tools (Istanbul, JaCoCo, Coverage.py)
- Coverage targets and goals
- Coverage limitations
- Mutation testing
- Quality over quantity

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### 1. Presentation (20-30 minutes)
- Unit testing fundamentals with examples

### 3. Resources & References (Provide 3-5 curated)
- "Test-Driven Development" by Kent Beck
- Unit testing framework documentation
- Mocking library guides
- TDD katas and exercises
- Testing best practices articles

### 4. Q&A Session (10-15 minutes)
- Prepare for questions about TDD practicality
- Testing private methods
- Coverage percentage targets
- Speed vs thoroughness
- Testing legacy code
