## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, the team should be able to:
1. Understand key code quality metrics
2. Measure and track quality over time
3. Use metrics to guide improvements
4. Avoid metric gaming

---

## Topics to Cover

### 1. Quality Metrics
- Code coverage (line, branch, function)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Code duplication
- Technical debt ratio
- Maintainability index
- Code churn

### 2. Measurement Tools
- Coverage tools (Jest, pytest-cov)
- SonarQube/SonarCloud
- CodeClimate
- Codacy
- Language-specific analyzers
- Custom metric dashboards

### 3. Tracking and Improvement
- Baseline establishment
- Trend analysis
- Quality gates
- Improvement targets
- Refactoring priorities
- Continuous monitoring

### 4. Avoiding Pitfalls
- Metrics as indicators, not goals
- Goodhart's Law awareness
- Context-specific interpretation
- Balancing metrics
- Not gaming the system
- Focus on value, not numbers
