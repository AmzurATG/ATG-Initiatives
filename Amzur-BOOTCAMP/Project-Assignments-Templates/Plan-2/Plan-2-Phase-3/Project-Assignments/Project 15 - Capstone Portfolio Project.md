## **Sample Capstone Project Framework**

### **Example: Real-Time Fraud Detection with Explainable AI**

#### **Project Overview**
```python
"""
Advanced Fraud Detection System with Explainable AI
==================================================

Problem: Traditional fraud detection systems lack interpretability,
making it difficult for financial institutions to understand and
trust AI decisions for regulatory compliance.

Solution: Build real-time fraud detection with SHAP explanations,
counterfactual analysis, and human-in-the-loop learning.

Innovation: Combination of ensemble methods with attention mechanisms
for both accuracy and interpretability.
