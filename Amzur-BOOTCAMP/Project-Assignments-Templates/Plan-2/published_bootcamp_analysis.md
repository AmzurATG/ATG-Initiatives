**Plan-1**: Detailed project specifications with task breakdowns, milestones, and time estimates
```

### **3. Assessment Framework**
```markdown
**Published**: Peer review, feedback, assessments (general mentions)
**Plan-1**: Detailed KPI framework with measurable goals and scoring weights
```

### **4. Progression Model**
```markdown
**Published**: Sprint-based with demos and README deliverables
**Plan-1**: Milestone-based with comprehensive review templates
```

### **5. Time Investment**
```markdown
**Published**: 38+ hrs/week (full-time intensive)
**Plan-1**: More flexible, outcome-based timing
```
