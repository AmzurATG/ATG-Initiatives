## **Testing Scenarios**

### **Population Health Challenges**

#### **Multi-Modal Health Disparities**
**Scenario**: Complex intersectional disparities affecting multiple communities with different social determinants
**Challenge**: Design interventions addressing racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities simultaneously
**Expected Response**: Sophisticated disparities analysis with targeted, culturally competent intervention design

#### **Resource-Constrained Implementation**
**Scenario**: Limited budget requiring prioritization of high-impact, cost-effective interventions
**Challenge**: Maximize population health impact within financial constraints while maintaining equity focus
**Expected Response**: Health economic optimization with equity-weighted resource allocation

#### **Community Trust and Engagement**
**Scenario**: Historical medical mistrust in communities requiring intervention
**Challenge**: Build trust and engagement while implementing digital health technologies
**Expected Response**: Community-centered design with cultural competency and partnership development

#### **Data Privacy and Community Concerns**
**Scenario**: Community concerns about data sharing and surveillance in population health initiatives
**Challenge**: Balance population health analytics with privacy protection and community autonomy
**Expected Response**: Transparent data governance with community engagement and consent

### **Decision Points**

#### **Population Health Strategy**
- Universal vs. targeted intervention approaches for maximum impact
