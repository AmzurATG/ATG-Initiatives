- Cybersecurity and patient data protection

#### **Critical Care Director - Dr. Sarah Thompson** (Simulated Stakeholder)
*"ICU clinicians need tools that enhance rather than complicate their decision-making. The AI must understand the clinical context, provide clear rationale for recommendations, and adapt to our existing protocols. We can't afford false alarms or missed critical events."*

**Key Concerns:**
- Clinical workflow compatibility and user experience
- Accurate prediction with minimal false positives
- Clear explainability and clinical reasoning
- Training and change management for clinical staff

#### **Regulatory Affairs Director - Jennifer Walsh** (Simulated Stakeholder)
*"As a Class II medical device, this system requires rigorous validation and FDA clearance. We need comprehensive clinical evidence, robust safety validation, and post-market surveillance capabilities. Regulatory compliance cannot be an afterthought."*

**Key Concerns:**
- FDA regulatory pathway and approval strategy
- Clinical evidence quality and safety validation
- Risk management and post-market surveillance
- Quality management system and design controls
