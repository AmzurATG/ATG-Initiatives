### Project Structure Architecture
- **Excellent**: The project follows the standard Flask application structure.
    - `app.py`: Main application file at the root.
    - `templates/`: Contains HTML templates.
    - `static/`: Contains CSS and JS files.
    - `requirements.txt`: Defines dependencies.
    - `.env.example`: Shows required environment variables.
- This organization is immediately familiar to any Python web developer and makes the project easy to navigate.

### Module Architecture Design
- The backend logic is contained within a single file, `app.py`. For an application of this size, this is perfectly acceptable and keeps the design simple.
- The frontend logic is similarly contained in `script.js`.

### Code Convention & Standards Architecture
- The code generally adheres to standard conventions for Python (PEP 8) and JavaScript, contributing to its clarity and maintainability.

**Code Organization Scoring:**
- **EXCELLENT (10/10)**: The project's organization is clean, standard, and professional. It demonstrates a strong understanding of how to structure a web application.
